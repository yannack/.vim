dotfiles
========

all my dotfiles (.vim, .liquidprompt, .bashrc, ...)

To install: 
-----------

Checkout the [provisioning](https://github.com/yannack/provisioning) project
which uses ansible, or use the following (will probably no longer be maintained
however).

```
git clone https://github.com/yannack/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles/
cd ~/.dotfiles
./setup.sh
```
